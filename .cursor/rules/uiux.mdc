# UI/UX Standards for ExpoGo Mobile Apps

## General Styling
- Use NativeWind (Tailwind utility classes for React Native) for all layout, spacing, color, and typography.
- Avoid custom inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
- Define and use a consistent color palette and font scale in the Tailwind config.

## Component Libraries
- Use the minimum number of third-party component libraries.
- For UI primitives (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.), use NativeWind utility classes and React Native built-in components.
- For icons, use `@expo/vector-icons`.
- For modals and overlays, use React Native's built-in `Modal` component or `react-native-modal` if advanced features are needed.

## Design Consistency
- Stick to a single design system throughout the app.
- Use consistent spacing, font sizes, and color palette (enforced via Tailwind config).
- Avoid mixing design paradigms (e.g., Material and iOS styles together).

## Accessibility
- All interactive elements must be accessible (labels, roles, touch targets).
- Use semantic components and accessibility props where possible.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast and readable font sizes.

## Navigation
- Use Expo Router or React Navigation for all navigation patterns.
- Keep navigation simple, predictable, and consistent.

## Performance
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders and heavy libraries.
- Prefer lightweight, well-maintained libraries.
- Optimize images and assets for mobile performance.
